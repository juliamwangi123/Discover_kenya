            <h5>Nairobi National Park</h5>
            <p>Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in 1946 about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife. Despite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <p class="red">Mt. Kenya attracts many tourist around the world like including hikers and
              climbers every year with it's high altitude adapted plains game, pristine wilderness with lakes, tarns, glaciers and peaks of great beauty. The climate in the park varies dramatically as you ascend the mountain. There
              can be
              vast changes in temperature between the day and night, with temperatures dropping to about 4 °C.
              Mount
              Kenya is generally very wet and is a watershed that provides water for large parts of Kenya. Like
              the rest
              of the country, as it is situated within the tropics, it receives two wet seasons and two dry
              seasons.

              Most of the precipitation occurs as frost or snow, which feeds the 11 remaining glaciers on the
              mountain.
              The south eastern slopes of the mountain receive the most rainfall as the warm moist air comes off
              the
              Indian Ocean.

          <div class="col">
            <p class="fist">Mount Kipipiri is an isolated volcano in the Wanjohi Valley, on the Kinangop Plateau near to
              the
              Aberdare Range. It is about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Lake Naivasha, which is visible from the
              summit.
              Wildlife includes Colobus and Sykes monkeys, elephants and buffalo and abundant birdlife.This hike will
              take you through dense forest, heath, and moorland vegetation with the peak almost on a bare rock
              surface
              with little high altitude vegetation. The walk up is long but beautiful landscapes will surely reward
              you.
              The plan is to start early to ensure we have ample time to summit and drive back to the city to arrive
              early in
              the evening.

          <p> Lake Victoria supports what may be the most productive freshwater fishery in the world. In addition to
            fishing, economic activities in the basin include agriculture, livestock, forestry, tourism, floriculture,
            hydropower generation, and transport. Crops grown in the watershed include maize, cotton, sisal, <br>
            tobacco, beans, sugarcane, and coffee.Rivers are of critical value in life by facilitating food production
            through irrigation, transport, power generation, sanitary services among many other essential uses
            necessary for human survival.We must protect water resources, conserve water at all times and always use
